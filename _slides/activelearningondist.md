  What if a machine could learn not just from data—but from curiosity?

  A child doesn’t learn by memorizing facts; they ask questions. “Why is the sky blue?” “What happens if I push this?” Curiosity drives deep understanding.

  Machine learning, by contrast, often resembles rote memorization—an endless pile of flashcards. It’s powerful but inefficient. My research aims to change that, building machines that learn through intelligent inquiry rather than brute force.

  The Core Challenge: The Bias of Our Questions

  When a system can only ask questions, a hidden problem emerges: its entire worldview becomes biased by the very questions it asks. It becomes an expert on the things it chose to ask about, while remaining blind to everything else. How do you ask questions that build a robust and unbiased understanding of the world, especially when the "answers" themselves are uncertain or the "examples" are complex, abstract concepts—like entire distributions of data, rather than single points?

  I developed a new, principled framework called Probabilistic Minimax Active Learning (PMAL). This isn't just another algorithm; it’s a fundamental shift in perspective, framing learning as a strategic game between the student (the machine) and the teacher (the data source).

  The goal? To ask the single most powerful question at every turn. PMAL identifies the question that, even under the worst-case scenario of an ambiguous or "inexact" answer, still guarantees the maximum possible improvement in understanding.

  It’s the learning equivalent of preparing for the worst while hoping for the best. This makes the system remarkably robust and efficient, capable of learning even from messy, real-world data where perfect answers don't exist.

  Beyond Data: Learning the Language of Concepts

  I’ve extended this idea to an even higher level—teaching machines to learn from distributions, not just data points. In other words, asking about categories or concepts rather than individual examples. This is a step toward AI that reasons more like humans, grasping structure and meaning rather than mere patterns.

  Ultimately, my work seeks to turn AI from a passive data consumer into an active, strategic partner in discovery—one that doesn’t just know the answers, but knows how to ask the right questions.
