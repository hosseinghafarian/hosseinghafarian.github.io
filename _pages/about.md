`Under Construction!`

My research is guided by a fundamental question: how can machines learn robustly from minimal and structured guidance? I approach this not just as an engineering challenge, but through the principled lens of learning theory, which provides the bedrock for understanding why certain algorithms generalize from so little.

This journey began during my PhD, where I grounded my work in convex optimization and active learning—exploring the theoretical principles that dictate how to learn the most from the least data. I then translated these principles into the domain of deep learning and `graph neural networks`, where the guidance itself is often a `relational structure`, and theory helps us navigate the trade-offs in these complex models.

Today, I'm focused on what I see as the next frontier: building models that don't just recognize patterns, but actively predict and internalize the underlying structure of the world. This shift from learning from structure to `learning about structure` is, at its heart, a theoretical leap toward creating more self-reliant and general intelligence.

I believe the bridge between research and production is built with clean, intentional code. My development process is guided by `proven software design principles`—emphasizing modularity, loose coupling, and clear abstractions—to create ML systems that are not only effective but also `testable`, scalable, and `easy to evolve`.
